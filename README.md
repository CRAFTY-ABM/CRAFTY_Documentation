Welcome to the documentation for the CRAFTY agent-based modelling (ABM)
framework. In the [wiki](../wiki), you can find instructions for installing and using
CRAFTY, descriptions and details of the framework, and example
applications. 

CRAFTY is a large-scale ABM of land use change. It has been designed to
allow efficient but powerful simulation of a wide range of land uses and
the goods and services they produce. It is fully open-source and can be
used without the need for any programming. An ODD description (1) is
available [here](attachments/189500917/314017260.docx).

-   At first, you might want to get to know CRAFTY\'s [Features and
    [Model
    Structure]{.confluence-link}](Features-and-Model-Structure_189500914.html)[.]{.confluence-link}
-   [It is then a good idea to choose the CRAFTY version you like to
    apply. Whereas the main documentation is tailored to basic CRAFTY,
    the other versions are described in section [Special Versions
    Documentation](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/CRAFTY/Special+Versions+Documentation).
    The subpages contain lists of particular versions\' features, but
    you may see
    [here](http://crafty-abm.sourceforge.net/){.external-link} for an
    overview.\
    ]{.confluence-link}
-   Then, go ahead [getting started with
    CRAFTY,](Getting-Started_189500941.html) including hints for getting
    help.
-   To configure your first model, but also for further reference the
    [Model Setup
    Documentation](Model-Setup-Documentation_189500942.html) is
    important.
-   Inspiration and ideas on how to represent specific issues may come
    form the [Applications](Applications_207660143.html) section.

If you need some valuable hints on developing the internal CRAFTY code,
don\'t miss [Development](Development_189500934.html).

In case you\'re looking for specific information an are not able to find
it, drop an email to <calum.brown@kit.edu> or <bumsuk.seo@kit.edu> saying what you miss
and where you are expecting that information.



# Versions

Currently, there are several editions/branches maintained (repositories at bitbucket contain the latest development including patches, template downloads usually contain the latest minor version including libraries):
